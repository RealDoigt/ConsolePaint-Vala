# ConsolePaint
This was a failed attempt to port my Boo ConsolePaint library to Vala a long time ago. The plan was to make the basic colour and terminal handling stuff in C then write the rest in Vala. Unfortunately, the the project was abandonned because I couldn't figure out a way to not print the ascii codes to the terminal.
